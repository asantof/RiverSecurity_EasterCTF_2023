I first went through the company's employees on LinkedIn and looking at the time they took their certifications.
Then I decided to stalk the company's LinkedIn page and I found a repost to a post made by one of their employees:

Searching for that course reveals it took place at the Marriott Hotel in Munich.

I looked that up in Google Maps:
![d42d741b7babd350726ce287eba37e60.png](:/167190745494437197e41e486fa5b165)

The coordinates are 48.1745733,11.5913587.
I can just supply that to geohash.org and then keep the first 7 characters.

The final answer is: u284pcb
